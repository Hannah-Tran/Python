#  PRACTICE OPPORTUNITY
# Assume that we have 3 clients who invested the following amounts in stocks earning 8% annually:** 
# client_investments = [\\$400,000  \\$45,000   \\$60,000]**     
# Complete the following tasks:**
# 1. Write a For loop that iterates over each element in the "client_investments" List, calculates the annual returns and places the results in another list named "client_returns"** 
# 2. Repeat the same operation using List Comprehension**
# 3. Compare the results from step 1 and 2 and perform a sanity check**

# Define a Python List
client_investments = [400000, 45000, 60000]
 
# Define a variable that holds the returns 
returns = 0.08 
7
# Let's define another empty List named "client_returns" to store the output 
client_returns = []
 
# Now we will create a For loop that goes over every element in the input List, 
# calculates the annual returns and places the results in another List named "client_returns"
for x in client_investments:
    client_returns.append(x * returns)
 
print(client_returns)
8
# Repeat the same excercise using List Comprehension
client_returns_list_comp = [ x * returns for x in client_investments]
client_returns_list_comp
9
# Assertions are statements that are used for code debugging and for performing sanity checks 
# Assertions are used to check if some condition is held True 
assert client_returns == client_returns_list_comp
